there was the Black Rabbit right in front of him! 
Maybe he is not a good swimmer like me, thought 
Rabbit, and he jumped into the river and swam to the 
other side. 
But as he pulled himself up onto the bank ... 
the Black Rabbit climbed out of the water too! 
"What do you want?" 
cried Rabbit, trembling. 
"Why are you following me?" 
But the Black Rabbit did not reply.

OH, NO, thought Rabbit. The Black Rabbit has found me. 
Rabbit ran as fast as he could out of the deep, dark forest,

Rabbit scrambled to his feet, but it was too late. 
He shut his eyes tight and waited for Wolf to attack. 
But nothing happened. 
Because there, standing in the sunlight behind 
Rabbit, was the Black Rabbit.

Black Rabbit was smiling back. 
Hand in hand, they bounced off across the field.
